                <h3>Traffic light detection using Matlab</h3>
                <p>  Traffic Light Detection Using MATLAB

                    Traffic light detection is important for smart vehicles and traffic management systems. By using MATLAB, we can create a system that identifies the color of traffic lights—red, yellow, or green—from images or video feeds.
                    
                    The process starts with capturing images of traffic lights. These images are then converted from RGB to the HSV color space, which makes it easier to detect specific colors. By setting color thresholds for red, yellow, and green, we create masks that isolate these colors.
                    
                    Next, we analyze these masks to find the largest connected areas, which likely correspond to the traffic lights. Finally, we can visualize the results by drawing bounding boxes around the detected lights on the original image.
                    
                    This simple system can be expanded for real-time applications, helping autonomous vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. Overall, traffic light detection using MATLAB showcases how technology can improve road safety and traffic management.</p>

                <h3>Emergency Oxygen Supply for Elevators and Resue system </h3>
                <p>An emergency oxygen supply and rescue system is essential for providing immediate access to oxygen and medical assistance during critical situations, such as medical emergencies, industrial accidents, or natural disasters. This system typically includes portable oxygen tanks and concentrators that vary in size to suit different environments. Pressure regulators control the flow of oxygen, which is delivered through masks or nasal cannulas to individuals in need.

                    Monitoring equipment, such as pulse oximeters, helps track blood oxygen levels and vital signs, while alarms alert responders to any changes in a patient’s condition. The system may also include rescue tools like stretchers and first aid kits to address immediate medical needs.
                    
                    Proper training for responders is crucial to ensure effective use of the system, along with established protocols for various emergency scenarios. Applications range from hospitals and ambulances providing oxygen to patients in respiratory distress, to industrial settings where workers may be exposed to hazardous conditions. During natural disasters, the system supports rescue teams in delivering critical care.
                    
                    Overall, the emergency oxygen supply and rescue system plays a vital role in enhancing survival rates and improving outcomes in life-threatening situations, ultimately saving lives when every second counts.</p>
